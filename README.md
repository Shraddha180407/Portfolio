About The Project
This is the official repository for my personal portfolio website. It is a fully responsive, single-page application designed to showcase my skills, projects, and journey as a Computer Science student and aspiring developer. The goal was to create a modern, immersive, and interactive experience that effectively communicates my passion for technology and design.

The entire site was built from scratch with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on clean code, performance, and a high-quality user experience.
